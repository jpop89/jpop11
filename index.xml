Even though I was bad at it in middle-school. It is important for me to challenge my sterile own beliefs, especially regarding my so-called inabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is for mathematics, which I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought I would eternally be bad at, from primary school onwards, I picked up programming (Python and later Go). I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dive into Foundational mathematics as I see no direct interest in it, but programming is the closest hobby that uses maths, and, for me, which is a victory over my past F student self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;ve got a goal set through learning German. The craziest is reading German Philosophy in its source language, but there is also a beauty, a complexity and craft in the language that I appreciate. Being able to connect to a culture through their language is for me a way to expand our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe settling for bilingualism only is not enough, and I need to pick up a third language. That is why I signed up for Ouino. I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to find a German person to converse with, like a &amp;rsquo;tutor'.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>setupanduses</title><link>http://localhost:1313/setupanduses/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 18:03:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/setupanduses/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="desktop-pc"&gt;Desktop PC&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neurodivergent Catholic christian, anarchist advocating for non-violent revolution, philosophy grad student working part time as an educator in a middle-school, computer science enthusiast and linux enjoyer, artist in my spare time, curious about the world and an anthropophile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="currently-"&gt;Currently :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in a quaint harbour-town somewhere in France. Francophone Canadian in the Great North and French with a British father in France. In my twenties and single.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-i-do-"&gt;What I do :&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m resuming my philosophy curriculum in an online school after a few short turns. I did not pursue my Communications &amp;amp; Marketing degree because I simply wanted to follow my desired academic route without looking for a profitable corporate career that did not align with my values, in a market that did not need me otherwise. In my spare time, outside of my day job and university studies, I try to learn everything there is about computer science, programming, web development and system administration. I love cooking, films and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title/><link>http://localhost:1313/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;e-mail : &lt;a href="mailto:jimmypop1968@proton.me"&gt;jimmypop1968@proton.me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
