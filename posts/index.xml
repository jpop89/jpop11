Even though I was bad at it in middle-school. It is important for me to challenge my sterile own beliefs, especially regarding my so-called inabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it is for mathematics, which I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought I would eternally be bad at, from primary school onwards, I picked up programming (Python and later Go). I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t dive into Foundational mathematics as I see no direct interest in it, but programming is the closest hobby that uses maths, and, for me, which is a victory over my past F student self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I&amp;rsquo;ve got a goal set through learning German. The craziest is reading German Philosophy in its source language, but there is also a beauty, a complexity and craft in the language that I appreciate. Being able to connect to a culture through their language is for me a way to expand our humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe settling for bilingualism only is not enough, and I need to pick up a third language. That is why I signed up for Ouino. I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to find a German person to converse with, like a &amp;rsquo;tutor'.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
