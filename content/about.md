# How I define myself  :

Neurodivergent Catholic christian, anarchist advocating for non-violent revolution, philosophy grad student working part time as an educator in a middle-school, computer science enthusiast and linux enjoyer, artist in my spare time, curious about the world and an anthropophile.

# Currently :

Living in a quaint harbour-town somewhere in France. Francophone Canadian in the Great North and French with a British father in France. In my twenties and single.
    
# What I do :

I'm resuming my philosophy curriculum in an online school after a few short turns. I did not pursue my Communications & Marketing degree because I simply wanted to follow my desired academic route without looking for a profitable corporate career that did not align with my values, in a market that did not need me otherwise. In my spare time, outside of my day job and university studies, I try to learn everything there is about computer science, programming, web development and system administration. I love cooking, films and poetry.
