      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-i-define-myself--&#34;&gt;How I define myself  :&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neuroatypical (bipolar I) Catholic christian, anarchist advocating for non-violent revolution, philosophy grad student working part time as an educator in a middle-school, computer science enthusiast and linux enjoyer, artist in my spare time, curious about the world and an anthropophile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;curently-&#34;&gt;Curently :&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Living in a quaint harbour-town somewhere in France. Francophone Canadian in the Great North and French with a British father in France. In my twenties and single.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-do-&#34;&gt;What I do :&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m resuming my philosophy curriculum in an online school after a few short turns. I did not pursue my Communications &amp;amp; Marketing degree because I simply wanted to follow my desired academic route without looking for a profitable corporate career that did not align with my values, in a market that did not need me otherwise. In my spare time, outside of my day job and university studies, I try to learn everything there is about computer science, programming, web development and system administration. I love cooking, films and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
